# Tweet Disaster Classification

## Overview

The goal of this project is to predict whether a given tweet is about a real disaster or not. If the tweet is about a real disaster, the prediction should be 1; otherwise, the prediction should be 0.

## Files

- `train.csv`: The training set containing tweets with labels.
- `test.csv`: The test set containing tweets without labels for prediction.
- `sample_submission.csv`: A sample submission file formatted correctly for submission.

## Columns

- `id`: A unique identifier for each tweet.
- `text`: The text content of the tweet.
- `location`: The location from which the tweet was sent (this may be blank).
- `keyword`: A particular keyword mentioned in the tweet (this may be blank).
- `target`: This column is only present in `train.csv` and denotes whether a tweet is about a real disaster (1) or not (0).

## Objectives

1. **Data Exploration**: Analyze the dataset to understand the distribution of classes, missing values, and other characteristics.
2. **Preprocessing**: Clean and preprocess the tweet text for modeling. This may include text normalization, tokenization, and handling missing values.
3. **Modeling**: Develop and train machine learning models to classify tweets into disaster or non-disaster categories.
4. **Evaluation**: Evaluate model performance using appropriate metrics and fine-tune for better accuracy.
5. **Submission**: Generate predictions for the test set and prepare a submission file in the required format.
